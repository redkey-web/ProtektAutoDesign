## Motorcycle paint Protection film (PPF)

Not only can [Paint Protection Film](https://www.protektauto.com.au/ppf-car-wrap-sydney) be applied to cars but it is commonly applied to Motorcycles as well. The Paint protection film can literally be applied to any painted or non-porous surfaces.

We carry a large database of standard kits for a wide range of popular Motorcycles which generally protect the front facing areas such as nose cone, headlights, leading edge of side fairings and wheel guards plus main wear and tear areas of the tank and rear duck tail/seat cowl.

However, we are also able to extend the kits to your own personal preference or custom design to your own particular specifications.

Our paint protection film is transparent and conforms to the lines and curves of surfaces which make it almost invisible. This allows the lines and colour of your vehicle to show though without compromising the appearance of the painted surfaces.

## Prices (based on full fairing sports bikes):

- **Standard Kit** (from) $850.00 includes nose cone, headlights, leading edge of side fairings and front wheel guard plus main wear and tear areas of the tank and rear duck tail/seat cowl.

- **Extended Kit** (from) $2200.00includes **Standard Kit** plus extended full side fairings (upper and lower) and top section of tank.

- **Full Custom kit**(from) $2950.00 includes all exterior painted surfaces custom wrapped.
